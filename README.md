## How to Run

To run the Solar System Simulation on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python and Fortran installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Solar-System-Simulation.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Solar-System-Simulation
   ```

4. **Compile and Execute**: Compile the Fortran code and run the Python front-end by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   ./run_simulation.sh
   ```

   This script will compile the Fortran code and then execute the Python program with Pygame to visualize the Solar System simulation.

## Documentation

The Solar System Simulation project is implemented in Fortran and Python. The Fortran code handles the backend calculations, while the Python code, along with Pygame, creates the interactive front-end.

The simulation uses Newton's law of universal gravitation to calculate the gravitational forces between celestial bodies, resulting in realistic planetary orbits.
